## Quick Codes for Day/Time Formatting

Rachel Williams

### What this resource is

- These codes can help you formate the date/time data that is collected. You can choose how you want it to be displayed and apply that formatting to your dataset. 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- If you have a dataset with date/time, you may find this helpful to organize the day/time in a way that you want it, rather than the way it autogenerated when the data was collected. You can change the time zone, and select how you want the day-month-year to appeare. Further, you may want to organize you dates/times, so having them all in the same formatting can be really helpful. 

### Advice on how to use

- Start by reading the introduction on the blog about how to use the differnt functions to format setting. I would definilty start by understanding if you want/need a time stamp as that may direct your function choice. date.as is a great function to use for just setting/formating the date, as is chron. Knowing what you want to do to organize the dates and seperating the dates and times into differnt columns may be something you want to do too.
